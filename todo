Many bases
Discounting
Rebasing
Not-rebasing (proxy)
Storing stuff for reuse
Grouping by term o/s
New Business
Batching of data through the GPU
2-D structures
Table lookups (not as complicated as currently?)
Results - complicated output (see above)
Phases (even for independent) due to need for proxies/interpolation
System variables (add to all-state?)
Generalised for basis "tree" (or graph?: "Basis-Graph") setting out dependencies of one basis on another (i.e. saying how much changes e.g. expenses only)
Use my arrayed calcs for multiple PVs or e.g. expenses bases
Force all (avoid Futhark being overly clever)
